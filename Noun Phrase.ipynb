    "## Approach of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizing\n",
    "In a program, text is represented as a string of characters. How can we go about moving one level of abstraction up, to the level of words, or tokens? To tokenize a sentence you may be tempted to use Pythonâ€™s .split() method, but this means you will need to code additional rules to remove hyphens, newlines and punctuation when appropriate.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using NLTK regular expression tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tagging\n",
    "The next step is tagging. This uses statistical data to apply a Part-of-speech tag to each token, e.g. ADJ, NN (Noun), and so on. Since it is statistical, we need to either train our model or use a pre-trained model. NLTK comes with a pretty good one for general use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunking\n",
    "Now we can use the part-of-speech tags to lift out noun phrases (NP) based on patterns of tags.Chunking is a term referring to the process of taking individual pieces of information (chunks) and grouping them into larger units. \n",
    "We can define the form of our chunks using a regular expression, and build a chunker from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walk the tree\n",
    "The output of chunking is a tree, where the noun phrase nodes are located just one level before the leaves, which are the words that constitute the noun phrase:"
